#TFTLCD

This is a library for arduino which happens to work with the touchscreen LCD that I got from ebay.

**THIS IS NOT MY CODE! It was from a random site mostly written in thai which I cannot find again. I just wanted to mirror it in case it helps anyone.**

It seems to be forked from adafruit's official library. But their's fails to work on my device and is a bit too bloated for my tastes.
